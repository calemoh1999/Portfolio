            <h3>Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Systems</h3>
            <h4 class="grey-text">Munster Technological University 2018-2022</h4>
            <p>
              <br>
              My journey led me to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Business 
              Information Systems at Munster Technological University. It 
              was an exciting adventure where I explored the fascinating blend 
              of business and technology. During my time in the program, I 
              discovered the magic of managing data, creating software, and
               analyzing business trends. I got to work with databases, coding 
               languages, and tools for crunching data. 
               <br> <br>
               The coursework was filled 
               with interesting projects that gave me a chance to dive into the world
                of real companies. Through these projects, I learned how theory and 
                practice come together to solve problems. This journey has not just 
                expanded my knowledge but also lit a fire in me to contribute to 
                innovative business solutions in the future.
