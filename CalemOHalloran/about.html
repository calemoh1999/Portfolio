            <h3>Designing With Passion While Exploring The World</h3>
            <div class="section-line"></div>
            <p>
                I recently graduated from Munster Technological University with a Bachelor's 
                Honours Degree in Business Information Systems. My work experience is quite 
                diverse, covering roles in production, customer service, and general operations. 
                I've also had the chance to lead teams, handle customer inquiries and complaints, 
                and take care of equipment.
                <br> <br>
                I am well-versed in following company policies and procedures and am committed to
                 delivering high-quality work. I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills I 
                 gained in university to a challenging role where I can make a positive difference. 
                 I am experienced in using Microsoft Office tools like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, 
                 and I'm comfortable with Data Analysis using RStudio and Tableau. I also have some 
                 familiarity with programming languages like HTML, CSS, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, and C#. 
                 I'm eager to keep learning and be part of a field that values growth and personal development.
