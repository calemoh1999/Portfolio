            <h3>Always Learning, Always Growing</h3>
            <p>
                I recently graduated from Munster Technological University with a Bachelor's 
                Honours Degree in Business Information Systems. My work experience is quite 
                diverse, covering roles in production, customer service, and general operations. 
                I've also had the chance to lead teams, handle customer inquiries and complaints, 
                and take care of equipment.
                <br> <br>
                I am well-versed in following company policies and procedures and am committed to
                 delivering high-quality work. I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills I 
                 gained in university to a challenging role where I can make a positive difference. 
                 I am experienced in using Microsoft Office tools like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, 
                 and I'm comfortable with Data Analysis using RStudio and Tableau. I also have some 
                 familiarity with programming languages like HTML, CSS, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, and C#. 
                 I'm eager to keep learning and be part of a field that values growth and personal development.

        <h3>Production Associate</h3>
        <p class="grey-text">2022-Present</p>
        <p>Here at Depuy Synthes, I produce products to the highest standards following set procedures.
            I ensure my work environment is in keeping with the company's 5S standard. I operate foundry 
            robots following the company's standard work schedules and perform 100% checks on all products 
            using equipment such as height gauges. I record all completed procedures on the company's

        <h3>Supervisor</h3>
        <p class="grey-text">2019-2022</p>
        <p>Working with Omniplex Cinemas, I was tasked with training new staff members on company policies, 
            procedures, and customer service standards. I monitored the daily operations of 
            the cinema, including managing staff, handling customer inquiries and complaints, 
            and ensured that the facility was clean and well-maintained at all times. I prepared 
            and served food and drinks from the concession stand, following all relevant health 
            and safety guidelines while suggesting additional products or upsell items to customers. 
            I maintained and repaired cinema equipment, including projection and sound systems, seating,
             and other infrastructure.</p>
